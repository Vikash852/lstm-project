# LSTM Project – Text Processing using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model using **Deep Learning** for text-based tasks.  
The model is designed to understand sequential data and generate meaningful predictions based on past context.

This project was developed and tested using **Google Colab** and implemented in **Python**.

## 🧠 What is LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data such as:
- Text
- Time-series data
- Speech

It overcomes the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs.
